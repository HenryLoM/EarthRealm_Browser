# EarthRealm Browser

EarthRealm is a simple web browser application built using PyQt5 and PyQtWebEngine. It is designed to be lightweight and customizable. I plan to integrate it into my own operating system. 
EarthRealm is an efficient web browser designed to deliver a seamless browsing experience even on less powerful devices. We extend a warm invitation for your valuable assistance.

## Features

- Basic web browsing functionalities (Back, Forward, Reload, Home)

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- Back: Cmd+B (macOS) or Ctrl+B (Windows/Linux)
